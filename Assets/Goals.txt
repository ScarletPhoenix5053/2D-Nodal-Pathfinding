2D Nodal Pathfinding:
/ Generate Node Mesh
/ Validate Nodes
* Generate Connections
- Cull Bad Nodes & connections
- Get Node from Click
- Generate A* path to target node

Implimentation notes:
Central NodalPathfinder handles all pathfinding.
	Other gameobjects call upon it with a GetPath type method.
	Contains an initialization method for setting up the nodemesh.
	Contains gizmo methods so peeps can see what they're doing.
	Customizable nodemesh
		Square or diamond (isometric) node shape
		Customizazble distances between nodes
		Custom editor that generates a preview before generating a new mesh to
		save processing power.

NodeMesh object generated by pathfinder stores node coordinates and valid paths
	> nodemesh saves all nodes and marks bad nodes for flexibility?
	nodemesh kulls bad nodes to save memory?

Validation
	use bounds.contains on all colliders on selected layers
	to check if a node is inside that collider
	Need to find colliders in an area. Physics.OverlapBox!

Draw connections
	draw gizmo connections idiot
